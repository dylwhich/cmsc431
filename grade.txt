===============================================================================

Correctness/Completeness (55%)
     (4 pts) Boolean type and constants for true and false are included in
             the language (not represented as 0 or 1 in code)
     (8 pts) Boolean operations NOT, OR and AND are supported
     (2 pts) Boolean values are printable (printing 0 or 1 is fine)
    (10 pts) Integer comparisons are correctly supported
    (10 pts) Floating point comparisons are correctly supported
     (7 pts) If statements are correctly supported
     (7 pts) While loops are correctly supported
     (7 pts) Conditional structures can be arbitrarily nested and mixed

Testing (30%)
     (5 pts) "Easy" testcase
    (10 pts) "Medium" testcase
    (15 pts) "Hard" testcase

Style (5%)
     (5 pts) Sensible names given to variables, functions, grammar symbols etc.
             Algorithms are not unnecessarily complex.
             Code adheres to a reasonable degree of neatness.
             Constants are declared for meaningful literal values when possible

Documentation (10%)
     (5 pts) Adequate documentation for files, functions, classes, complex 
             parts of code, etc.
     (5 pts) Man page describes structure and features of the language

Comments:

Bison on the GL servers doesn't support hyphens in the names of grammar
symbols - consider replacing these with underscores. Assuming those were to
be replaced, everything would work perfectly. Test cases are good. Code
and documentation look good too. Well done!
