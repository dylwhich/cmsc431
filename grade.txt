             newline and no newline
    (10 pts) Floating point math works correctly (addition, subtraction,
             multiplication, division, exponentiation, negation)
-2   (4 pts) Compiler correctly prints integer and float math expressions

     (5 pts) Compiler includes assignment statements
     (5 pts) Variable values are correctly updated in assignments
     (5 pts) Type checking is correctly performed in assignments statements

Testing (30%)
     (5 pts) "Easy" testcase
    (10 pts) "Medium" testcase
    (15 pts) "Hard" testcase

Style (5%)
     (5 pts) Sensible names given to variables, functions, grammar symbols etc.
             Algorithms are not unnecessarily complex.
             Code adheres to a reasonable degree of neatness.
             Constants are declared for meaningful literal values when possible

Documentation (10%)
     (5 pts) Adequate documentation for files, functions, classes, complex 
             parts of code, etc.
     (5 pts) Man page describes structure and features of the language

Comments:

Higher level documentation for functions might be helpful. I was able to 
figure out what they do from their names though.

Printing floating point values produces a "mismatch in operand sizes" error 
when the code is assembled on the GL servers. Changing the "movlps" 
instructions to "movq" instructions seemed to fix it. 
All other functionality looks great!
